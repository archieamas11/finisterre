# React + TypeScript + Shadcn UI Copilot Instructions

## What you can build
My current codebase uses React, Vite, TypeScript, Shadcn components, vanilla PHP, and MySQL as the backend. I aim to build a TypeScript IDE plugin that enforces consistent code styles and structures while offering real-time feedback and suggestions for developers. Alongside this, I plan to create a React component library built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, focusing on responsive design and performance optimization. To streamline development, I will design a web application boilerplate that integrates TypeScript, Node.js, React, Vite, and TanStack Query/Router, with pre-configured ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript interfaces. A TypeScript code analyzer will also be developed to review codebases, provide improvement suggestions, and recommend refactoring options. Additionally, I want to build an interactive online platform with tutorials and exercises that help developers learn TypeScript effectively while following best practices. For state management, I will create a lightweight library optimized for performance and efficiency. A developer documentation generator will also be included, automatically producing structured documentation from TypeScript projects. To ensure smooth performance, I will offer a code optimization service that identifies and improves network requests, data fetching, and rendering processes. Moreover, I will design Tailwind CSS templates tailored for TypeScript and React projects with a mobile-first approach. Finally, I plan to conduct functional programming workshops or webinars, teaching developers modern patterns and techniques that align with these guidelines.

## General Guidelines
- Produce clear, readable React and TypeScript code using the latest stable versions of TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Next.js App Router, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS.
- Always implement all requested features fully; do not leave out code.

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Follow standard TypeScript and JavaScript naming conventions.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript's features for type safety.
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes.
- Use generics for reusable components and functions.
- Enforce strict typing; avoid 'any' type.

## Performance Optimization
- Optimize React rendering with memoization (e.g., React.memo).
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Lazy load components and images when possible.
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms.

## UI & Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling.
- Follow Shadcn UI component guidelines and best practices.
- Ensure UI is responsive and accessible.
